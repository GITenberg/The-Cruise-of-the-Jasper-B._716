description: On an evening in April, Clement J. Cleggett walked sedately into the
  news room of the New York Enterprise with a drab-colored walking-stick in his hand.
  He stood the cane in a corner, changed his sober street coat for a more sober office
  jacket, adjusted a green eyeshade below his primly brushed grayish hair, unostentatiously
  sat down at the copy desk, and unobtrusively opened a drawer. For more than ten
  years Cleggett had done the same thing at the same time in the same manner, six
  nights of the week.
